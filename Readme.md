# BigCommercePinterestFeedGenerator

Despite many paid solutions that use recurring monthly charges for their customers,
this project aims to create the first open-source feed generator for Pinterest using
BigCommerce store data. 

In doing this, our goal is to present small-business owners with no IT background
a more affordable yet transparent way for automating the tedious task of export BigCommerce
catalog data to their Pinterest business profile. Our gain is to provide customer support at
inexpensive rates compared to current market rates. Your gain is to know how we do it, so you
can be independent of depraving monthly-charges with no reason for them to be.

## Disclaimer: 

Our solution uses a modified version of the BigCommerceAccess.dll library, which was originally
obtained from [skuvault/bigCommerceAccess](https://github.com/skuvault/bigCommerceAccess) Github
repository. The modified library fully recognizes the license granted by their original authors,
and can be accessed from the [modified BigCommerceAccess library](https://github.com/OnInitiative-com/bigCommerceAccess)
implemented by our team.
